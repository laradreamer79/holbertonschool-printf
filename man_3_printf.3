NAME
     _printf

LIBRARY
     Custom printf function

SYNOPSIS
#include <stdio.h>


int
     _printf(const char * restrict format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
The _printf() family of functions produces output according to a format as described below.The _printf() function write the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
     are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which
     results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
     introduced by the % character.  The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier


SUPPORTED CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.

C	The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is
written.
S	The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
(pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating NUL character

%	A ‘%’ is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion
specification is ‘%%’.
%d, %i		The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

RETURN VALUES
These functions return the number of characters printed (not including the trailing ‘\0’ used
     to end output to strings).
These functions return a negative value if an error occurs.
